# YouTube Video Download API

YouTube Video Download API uses the open-source **youtube-dl** program to download videos from YouTube. Simply provide a YouTube video URL and the actor will save it under the `VIDEO` key in the actor's key-value store in an **mp4** format. Information about the video such as its title, description, formats and other metadata are stored as **JSON** under the `INFO` key.
